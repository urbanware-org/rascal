## Definition

The *Rascal* project is a simple string manipulation tool that replaces letters, numbers and further characters with random user-defined ones.

[Top](#rascal-)

## Details

A few years ago, I developed a project called *1337 Converter* just for fun, which simply converted text into leetspeak. Quite some people used it to strengthen their passwords consisting of words to avoid or at least complicate dictionary attacks.

For example, the password `maverick` was converted to `[V]4vE|2!(k`.

So, in first place, *Rascal* is (or has become) a password scrambler to strengthen weak passwords based on words by replacing their letters, numbers and further characters with random resembling user-defined ones. Of course, it still works as text-to-leetspeak converter as well.

## Usage

In the `docs` sub-directory of the project, there are plain text files containing a detailed documentation for each component with further information and usage examples.
